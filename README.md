### hi

<p align="left" style="width: 50%">
  I'm a CS student at AU's Institute of Computer Science, with a bit of previous experience.</p>
  I can program C#, Rust, Python, HLSL/ShaderLab and JS (in order of confidence).</p>
  Along with languages I have some experience in Unity Engine, shader development, game design, Git/SCMs and shell scripting (mostly PowerShell).</p>
  On my GitHub profile you'll find a bunch of public repositories representing some of my projects which I am able to present publically. Very few of my things are meant to be used by other people, I just like having it accessible for anyone who wants to read my source code.</p>
