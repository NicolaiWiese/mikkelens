### hi

<div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative">
  <p style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">I'm a CS student at AU's Institute of Computer Science, with a bit of previous experience.
  I can program C#, Rust, Python and JS (in order of confidence).</p>

</div>

<p>Along with languages I have some experience in Unity Engine, shader development, game design, Git/SCMs and shell scripting (mostly PowerShell).</p>

<p>On my GitHub profile you'll find a bunch of public repositories representing some of my projects which I am able to present publically. Very few of my things are meant to be used by other people, I just like having it accessible for anyone who wants to read my source code.</p>
