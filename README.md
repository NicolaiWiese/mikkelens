### hi

<p>I'm a CS student at AU's Institute of Computer Science, with a bit of previous experience.
I can program C#, Rust, Python and JS (in order of confidence). Along with languages I have some experience in Unity Engine, shader development, game design, Git/SCMs and shell scripting (mostly PowerShell).</p>
